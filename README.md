# Hello_World-
Make a difference by coding.
On 18th December 2017, I had my first GitHub account for the first time.
A couple of days ago, I started learning HTML and WordPress. They are very interesting so I want to learn more on web designing and coding.
Today is 10th March, 2019, and I come back to my Github account.
About one year has past. During the period, many things happened: I got married; I changed my job; my husband got his driving license; I passed two professional exams which are quite disturbing etc.
I have made up my mind to learn front-end development well because I want to be a full-stack web developer and do something different.

## This is a testing push.
