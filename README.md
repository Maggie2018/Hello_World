# Hello_World-
Make a difference by coding.
On 18th December 2017, I had my first GitHub account for the first time.
A couple of days ago, I started learning HTML and WordPress. They are very interesting so I want to learn more on web designing and coding.
Today is 10th March, 2019, and I come back to my Github account.
About one year has past. During the period, many things happened: we got married; changing jobs; my husband has got a driving license; I passed two professional exams which are quite disturbing etc.
I have made up my mind to learn front-end development well because I want to be a full-stack web developer and do something different.

## This repository is for testing and simple tracking.
Today is 19th May 2019. About two months has passed and I learned how to make my own pushes & pulls via GitHub Desktop and Git Bash, which really took me some time to get used to the geek way. I finished some challenges on FCC and finished a small entry-level project. More is ahead and I am looking forward to it. Yesterday I got to know more about CodePen.io, a fantastic website for front-end learners where we can find so many experienced web designers there and learn from their codes. The split editing view is unique and helpful because users can code html, css and javascript separately, which is quite straightforward and clear. The export of code packages are also convenient and the fork function on codepen.io is very similar to that on GitHub.
